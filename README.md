# ðŸ“½ DIGITAL FILE BACKUP SYSTEM
## overview
The people are no need to carry all the documents with them every time. If the person need to open an account in bank then he needs to bring all the necessary documents, this can be a big task for a common man to carry all the documents. Sometimes people may lost their original documents in natural disasters this can be prevented by storing all the document in one place and can access their documents for any of their official work .This requires lot of paper and need to be stored in a secured room and it is very difficult to search for particular document if it was lost. The paper quality will also be lost if the documents were stored for longer time.
## ðŸ”­ Objectives
1. Eliminate need for the residents to maintain hard copy of government issued
documents.
2. Eliminate need for the residents to produce (in hard format) government issued
documents, while applying for services.

mechanism to digitize older documents that may not have machine readable formats.
8. Provide a default portal and mobile application for residents to view their documents in
a consolidated way.
## ðŸ§ª PROJECT TESTING
Software Testing Strategies
1.	Unit test
2.	Integration test
3.  Performance test
##ðŸ“³ Modules:
a.	Admin 
b.	Citizen
c.	Officer
## Future enhancement
We have implemented the  project with database and added the citizen details and images of citizen proofs are added so that the citizen can just remember the adhar number to get all his id proofs from anywhere in the world and can view his details

This system can be used easily by the users to access their documents which help them form carrying all the documents. This is avoids paper free and fast accessing of citizen documents.
